## Description
This repository was built to practice my node.js and OOP skills. I built an SVG generator app which uses the command line and user inputs to generate 300px by 200px SVG's. It was great practice on using the inquirer, fs and jest node modules. Specifically, using OOP, I learned how to simplify and organize my code using abstraction. Also, I was able to learn how to use jest to create tests to make sure my classes were working as intended. By doing this, I learned how to test that error's get thrown where intended.

## Installation
The project can be installed from GitHub through a variety of methods -- zip file, clone it, fork it, etc.

## Usage
This project can be used from your command line. Open your command line to the directory where this app is installed. Download the required dependencies found in the package.json file. Run "node index.js" and fill-in the prompts. You'll then find a new SVG file in the example folder.
